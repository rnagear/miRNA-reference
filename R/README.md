Script files performing the processing of previously established databases in preparation for integration
into a single reference table. All data from the sources are included as-is, with presence in the database
taken to indicate a predicted positive interaction. The one exception is miRMap, which provides a complete
set of score data. For this dataset, only interactions with scores < 0.05 were taken to indicate a prediction
of miRNA targeting of a gene. Refer to original publications for complete descriptions of calculation and
interpretation of reported scores.
